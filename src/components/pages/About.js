      system enviornments. I have a vast knowledge of programming languages 
      and expertise in several different software tools along with operating 
      systems. For 18 years I worked in the IBM mainframe enviornment and 
      for the last 10 years I've been working in Unix, Linix and PC 
      enviorments. Mostly building GUI applications and working with several 
      different database structures. All of which led me to develop some new 
      abilities working with websites. From building "front-end" HTML web 
      pages to structurdised "back-end" databases also known as a full-stack 
      developer or commonly known as a web developer.
