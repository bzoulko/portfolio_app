React Challenge: React Portfolio

# Module 20 Challenge Project - REACT Portfolio
This program is a great example of what I can do as a web developer, it showcases my ability to use REACT and an abundant of other methods and API's to produce something for myself. This is my protfolio, which has several module challenges on display. You can see my resume, work challenge history and coding abilities by clicking links from each work listed to its GitHub or Deployment location. Please take time and review my work ethics and resume.


## Working the Portfolio
* At the top of the page, I've outlined and enhanced a header to show who this portfolio belongs to. Then you'll see a toggle switch, which I thought was a nice little touch, that will change the application theme from light to dark mode, and back to light if you prefer. Next there's a series of tabs to click on:
    
    - About: All about me and what I can do as a developer in general. Gives my back ground history of the last 20+ years in development.
    
    - Portfolio: Show cases the work modules that I've done most reciently in UCSD's Extende Studies Coding Bootcamp. Each module being showcased is followed by pictures and two links. One link for the deployment and the second to my GitHub repository where the code is available to see.

    - Contact: Here I've setup a contact page so you can either call, email, or visit either one of my accounts (LinkedIn or Indeed).

    - Resume: This page displays my most recient resume for all employers to see and hopefully find that I meet several of there needs.
